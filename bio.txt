Bio

I solve weird problems. My entire career in technology has focused on
getting businesses and organizations through situations where conventional
sources of support fail, or won't even try. I've fixed an obscure problem
with the files containing an author's manuscript, allowing his book to go
to press, I've helped identify and fix mysterious intermittent communications
problems in an office tower related to vibration from a freight elevator,
developed an outside-the-box backup solution for a large telephone system
with failed backup hardware, identified a means of solving an apparently
insoluble issue that same phone system's dial plans being unable to
correctly route local and long distance calls after changes to the PSTN
that the designers didn't anticipate, created a server virtualization plan for
a business with a complex mixture of current and legacy infrastructure, and
helped a University of Washington researcher interface a gas chromatograph
to a mass spectrometer.

What makes me different? I developed a strong, intuitive grasp of troubleshooting
at an early age, due to exposure to an unusually broad combination of technology.
I earned a ham radio license before I was in middle school, received one-on-one
mentoring in building autonomous mobile robots by a mechanical engineer. I finagled
a legitimately-licensed 16 user copy of SCO OpenServer (A System V-based Unix)
at age 14. I assembled a 486 computer with a then-large amount of RAM, a SCSI
host bus adapter, two multi-port serial boards, and a special Packet Ensemble
Protocol modem to run it on. Despite a lack of software beyond that included
with the operating system, no direct access to the internet, and mostly obsolete
reference materials available through my local library, I was able to learn
a great deal, sometimes to the detriment of my studies.
